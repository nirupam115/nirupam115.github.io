<!--             <p> <b>Research Work:</b> Broadly, I am interested in design and analysis of algorithms for distributed optimization and machine learning. 
				My recent research work focuses on Byzantine fault-tolerance (or robustness to adversarial nodes) in distributed (including decentralized) machine learning. 
				Some of the challenges in this topic that I am currently pursuing are data heterogeneity, (differential) privacy constraints, and sparse communication topology. </br>

				In the past, I have also worked on pre-conditioning of the gradient-descent method, applied to the distributed optimization framework. 
				During my PhD, my work primarily focused on the issues of robustness (to adversarial actors) and privacy in distributed optimization and average consensus. </br>

			<p>
				<strong>I'm looking for motivated PhD students and Postdocs</strong>, to work with me on the following topics. If you are interested in any of these projects, please feel free to reach out to me (nigu[at]di.ku.dk).
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li> <strong>Robust and Private Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Data.</strong>  
					While traditional federated learning approaches focus on model accuracy, this project aims to enhance both robustness and privacy in federated settings, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous data distributions.
					Challenges include addressing robustness against data and model poisoning in presence of data heterogeneity, ensuring privacy constraints (such as differential privacy), and optimizing communication efficiency. 
					This project will explore novel algorithms and frameworks to tackle these challenges effectively.
					Main focus of the project is theory and algorithm design. Applications include healthcare, finance, and other domains where data privacy is crucial. </br>
					As part of this project, I have co-authored this book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-97-0688-4" target = "_blank">Robust Machine Learning: Distributed Methods for Safe AI</a> that provides a pedagogical overview of robust machine learning.
					Additionally, I have contributed a chapter in this (open access) book <a href="https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/90897" target = "_blank">Large Language Models in Cybersecurity</a>, highlighting the
					difficulty for achieving provable robustness & privacy in LLMs.</br>
					<span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">Call for collaboration:</span> If you are interested in collaborating, please reach out! I am currently collaborating with researchers from EPFL, INRIA (Montpellier & Sofia-Antilpolis) and Sorbonne University on various aspects of this project. </span></li>

				<li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Robustness in Decentralized Learning over Sparse Communication Graphs.</span> In a peer-to-peer (P2P) setting, this project investigates the robustness of decentralized learning algorithms when communication is limited to a sparse graph structure. 
					Key challenges include ensuring reliable model updates despite potential adversarial nodes and optimizing the trade-off between communication efficiency and learning accuracy. 
					Existing approaches on robustness often rely on either centralized architectures or strong assumptions about the communication graph, which may not be feasible in decentralized settings. 
					Applications include distributed sensor networks, edge computing, and other scenarios such as drone networks where robustness against communication/node failures is essential.</li>
				<li> <strong>Robust Federated Inference.</strong> This project focuses on enhancing the robustness of federated inference mechanisms, ensuring reliable and accurate predictions even in the presence of adversarial clients or unreliable communication channels.</li>
				<li> <strong>Fairness in Robust Distributed Learning.</strong> This project aims to address fairness concerns in distributed learning settings, ensuring that models are not only robust but also equitable across different user groups and data distributions.</li>
				<li> <strong>Robustness in Large Language Models (LLMs).</strong> This project investigates the unique challenges of ensuring robustness in LLMs, particularly in the context of adversarial attacks and data poisoning.</li>
